= Best Practices for AWS Lambda

. Keep Lambda and function separate - Write your function to be Lambda-agnostic. Then write a thin Lambda handler which acts as a proxy or router.
. Packaging - One fat JAR with multiple handlers or multiple JARs with single handler? Its recommended to package one Lambda in a single JAR file. This follows Separation of Concerns principle.
. How multiple versions of Lambda functions can be managed?
. Organization of `pom.xml` with multiple Lambdas
. Sharing code between different Lambda functions - Create a library and package with multiple Lambda functions.
. Different API versions accessing Lambda functions
. Dev, test and production in a team environment
. Swagger integration
. Database connection - Use a database connection pooling library instead of initializing database connection for each Lambda invocation.
